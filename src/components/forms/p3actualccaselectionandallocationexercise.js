              Dear Parents/Guardians,
              <br />
              <br />
              Thank you for supporting the P3 CCA Experience Programme. We hope
              that your child/ward has gained insights to what each CCA group
              entails in Pei Chun Public School.
              <br />
              <br />
              Your child/ward may now select his/her 5 CCA, in ranked order, by completing this registration form. Please note that he/she is allowed to make multiple changes to the selected choices before the deadline. 
              <br />
              <br />
              Do kindly note that the registration period is from 12 March 2021 (Term 1 Week 10, Friday), 7.00 p.m. to 17 March  2021 (Term 1 March Holiday, Wednesday) 12.00 noon.
              <br />
              <br />
              The result of the CCA selection exercise will be available from Term 2 Week 1, Tuesday onwards.
              <br />

              <li>The allocation of CCA is not by first-come-first-serve basis.</li>
              <br />
              <li>The selection and allocation of CCA is independent of (is not influenced by) the choices made during the CCA Experience Programme.</li>
              <br />
              <li>Your child/ward has to indicate all his/her 5 selected CCAs choices, in ranked order (i.e. in order of preference). The school will strive to allocate the most preferred choice made by your child.</li>
              <br />
              <li>Your child/ward may make changes to his/her selected choices till the last day of the selection exercise (and the system will only take the last submission into consideration).</li>
              <br />
              <li>Refer to the CCA portal (<a href='https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/ccainfo' target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://sites.google.com/moe.edu.sg/ccainfo</a>) for the latest CCA training schedule so as make arrangements for after-school transport and student care.  </li>

          <p>Findings from previous years' data:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>More than 90% of the P3 cohort took part in the their P3 Actual CCA Selection and Allocation Exercise.</li>
            <br />
            <li>We have close to 80% of participating students getting their 1st Choice CCAs.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Any choice left with blank will be a disadvantage to your child/ward and MAY result in him/her NOT being allocated a CCA ultimately.</li>
            <br />
            <li>Do NOT select the same CCA twice or more. The repeated options will be voided (Do NOT waste your chance(s) with such mistake; your child/ward may end up without an allocated CCA eventually).</li>
            <br />
            <lI>This year, there is no restriction to the number of selection for each CCA category. However, it is ADVISABLE for your child/ward to choose his/her 5 CCAs from at least 2 categories and also AVOID choosing all the overly subscribed CCAs like Basketball (Boys), Table Tennis (Boys), Wushu (Boys), Wushu (Girls), Art Club, #Digi.ME.</lI>
